### run
execute `make;./arbitrary` in the terminal
### result
If the magnifier succeeds, the output will show that accumulated timing difference is linear to their magnify rounds, as each round will add the same amount of timing difference. The timing difference might grow slower or stop growing and start shifting more from a straight line after the round number is bigger than some threshold as is shown in figure 11. The result of a successful run is shown in the [succeed_result_arbitrary.png](./succeed_result_arbitrary.png).
